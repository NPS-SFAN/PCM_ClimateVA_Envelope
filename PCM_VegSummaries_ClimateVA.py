PCM_VegSummaries_ClimateVA.py
Script performs summary of the NAWMA Vegetation Plot of the Plant Communities Monitoring Protocol.
Summary is to be used for identifying highest cover taxon by PCM Community Type to be used in as
part of the SFAN PCM Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment.

Output tables:
NAWMACoverEventALL - All Taxon Average Cover By Event/Plot Scale
NAWMACoverEventTopTwoTop - Two Taxon Highest Average Cover By Event/Plot Scale
NAWMACoverMonCycleAll - All Taxon Average Cover By Community Monitoring Cycle Scale
NAWMACoverMonCycleTopTwo - Top Two Taxon Highest Average Cover By Community Monitoring Cycle Scale
NAWMACoverCommunity - All Taxon Average Cover By Community across all monitoring cycles
NAWMACoverCommunityTopTwo - Top Two Taxon Highest Average Cover By Community across all monitoring cycles
